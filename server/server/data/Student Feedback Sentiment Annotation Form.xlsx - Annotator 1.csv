(he's my only 2.# in every sem along with 2 other profs, one is his wife T___T) its hard to enjoy his sub for the fact that i think he enjoys making his student suffer with his subject. (its my observation okay?) he isnt that considerate also, pretty mid with teaching. very scary with both as a prof and with grade giving. (he failed half of our class because of the surprise finals, which we thought was just a simple quiz day, i did well and was thankful that i didn't fail, but still, its pretty odd). ",Select---

"I would recommend incorporating more engaging teaching methods to make the course more dynamic and interactive. For instance, integrating group discussions, hands-on activities, or real-world examples could enhance student interest and participation.

Regarding assessments, it would be helpful to adopt a more inclusive quiz format that caters to different learning styles. Providing written copies of the questions alongside verbal instructions or allowing a slightly extended time limit could create a fairer and less stressful environment for all students.",Acceptance,"What u deeply appreciate about his teaching is his unwavering commitment to punctuality and consistency, as he has never missed class. This reliability creates a sense of discipline and respect in the learning environment. Additionally, his use if visual aids and well - structure presentations enhances the teaching process.",Joy,"One aspect of his teaching that I found challenging was the lack of engagement during class. At times, it felt like we were merely fulfilling our roles as students and teacher, rather than genuinely immersing ourselves in the learning process. Admittedly, part of this may be my own responsibility, but I believe that Sir Arip also shares some accountability for making the class less stimulating.

Additionally, I struggled with his quiz format, which involved reading questions aloud twice with a strict time limit. This approach often felt rushed and made it difficult for me, as someone who processes information better through reading than listening, to perform at my best. I believe this style of assessment may have posed similar challenges for my peers as well. A more balanced or inclusive approach to quizzes could help accommodate different learning and comprehension styles.  I truly hope sir arip would take this into consideration. ",Select---,"I hope that [PROFESSOR] could be more approachable in his interactions with students.

She often speaks loudly or even eats in front of the students, a behavior that is also observed in other groups.

The course is too hard. One semester is not enough ",Select---,He's a good person.,Select---,"
Software Engineering is a vital subject for our academic and future professional careers, but unfortunately, the way the course was handled made it difficult for us to learn effectively. Throughout the semester, the professor often failed to communicate clearly with the class, and when instructions were given, they were either unclear or provided too late to be useful. He was frequently absent and difficult to reach, which made it challenging for students, like me to seek clarification or guidance. Also, there was a noticeable lack of support and involvement, and at times, it felt as though he did not genuinely care about the students’ learning or progress.

 These issues significantly impacted the overall learning experience and made it harder for us to engage with the subject matter in a meaningful way

",Select---," It would be very helpful if the professor could be more present, establish clear communication channels, provide timely and detailed instructions, and offer more availability to support students. These changes would greatly enhance the learning experience and help students succeed in a subject as important as Software Engineering.",Select---

Her simplicity and sincerity in teaching make complex topics easier to grasp, and we truly appreciate how much she genuinely cares about our growth. ",Select---,nothing,Select---,nothing,Select---

"for course itself, i dont have anything.",Select---,"she likes doing recitations but in a way you wouldnt get pressured and scared. like she'll accept any answers you'll provide and i like how she gives out extra points with students that participate, it makes her class fun with all the student teacher interactions, and for me it helps me digest her topic more. also she's nice and quite easy to approach, i like her tone. she doesnt scare me in a bad way. ",Select---,"i was so down with our midterms hahaha, i failed miserably as it was a surprise midterms and all of the questions, i mean not all but most of them did not exist on her given lectures nor we discussed about it. felt bad about that day and i think thats the reason why my grade got pulled down. i mean im pretty sure i did well for the laboratory but since theres an alteration with the grading system, i think this pulled me down. ",Select---,"maybe less on the presentation reading, and the surprise big exams.",Select---
"more explanation on the codes purpose and what it does. specially the different algorithms thing, cause as of now with capstone it would be a great help if i understood those last sem. its hard trying to learn from scratch again.",Select---,"sir is nice, he's calm and very considerate. you wont be scared with approaching him. and his exams are hard yes, but most of them are in the ppts he sent and lectures that we discussed so its actually good.",Select---,i still get sleepy in his class T________T,Select---,maybe he could actually teach us the specific purpose and what do the codes do instead of making us copy all the stuff he shares on the tv and see if it works on our end.,Select---
"nothing much, the flow of this subject was okay. ",Select---,"shes very nice and she cares about how much her student learns, and is willing to explain things over and over again just for the student to digest the lessons. she gives direct feedback also with your outputs and encourages you to study more when she notice ure failing ur quizzes and exam. ",Select---,"i'll say she improved a lot now than how she was before, and im thinking its just cause she was pregnant that time, thats why she was so scary and grumpy all the time.",Select---,none so farrrr,Select---
"To be honest, some PCs in the laboratory were not working and malfunctioning which caused some students not to engage and participate in the class especially on onhands activities.",Select---,Always straight to the point that's easy to understand which is why students were also on the same page as his.,Select---,There were some questions in the exams that was not discussed in the lesson.,Select---,Nothing else.,Select---
"nothing much, the subjects hard so yeah brain capacity matters.",Select---,"i like the activities, the copying stuff but theres an actual error and u need to understand so u can fix it and stuff. also he sends the ppt and lectures when we ask for it, so pretty cool. its helpful. sir is also approachable and i like how he is nice to us (might jinx XD), kinda playful in a way that makes me feel less tense and scared about faculty profs.",Select---,"he's so strict with ""dont be late"" ""be on time"" ""XX am/pm sharp"" but doesnt do it himself anyway T____T",Select---,"im upset, i tried my best and i obviously did okay in terms of hands on activity, exam, and quizzes. (compared to my classmates [as far as i know but i will stand corrected if im wrong]) cause i tried hard to learn stuff. just for them to have higher or same grades as me cause they got pulled by the other subject. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA. its okay though, its for the benefit of everyone i guess. i mean its obviously my fault for not balancing both lecture and laboratory, but in my head, laboratory matters more cause its like 60-70% of the overall grade for the subject. so i tried to focus on one thing. yeah end up with me disappointing myself all over again.",Select---
