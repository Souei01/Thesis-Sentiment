The only problem is the attendance of the professor during class schedules.,Acceptance
More practicality,Acceptance,"On how he is very chill, yet strict in teaching, submitting and checking of outputs.",Satisfaction,"they would sometimes go overtime during their lectures, but understandable due to the subject being explained thoroughly",Acceptance,I hope in the upcoming sem he will be fair to us students or who will be his students because many students are failing.,Disappointment

Cannot specify the fields to improve in this course since for the whole semester we only meet for like 3 to 5 times.,Disappointment,"he explains topic well and responds to questions that are being asked. i also kind of like that he uses literal word for word from modules to exam, but then makes us learn nothing. more on memorization and remembering words, more than digesting the actual lesson. ",Disappointment,"less activities, our instructor focuses on discussing the lesson",Disappointment,"the exams are really hard, and if u fail a certain exam, see u next yr again. instead of learning, what we learn is the trauma on what topics will be given in the exam since it's pretty random and if u think the enumeration on the quiz will be shown on the exam, nope; in the exam day it will be different, it has nothing to do with the quiz ",Disappointment
needs more hands on practice on lesson (e.g: coding in the lab while learning the lesson),Acceptance,"Nothing, since the instructor didn't teach us anything from the start.",Disappointment,Does not meet regularly.,Disappointment,He do not take considerations,Disappointment
"the exam/quizzes, it's more on memorization and not leaning on learning.",Acceptance,"Honestly, there's nothing really noteworthy. Most of the time I feel nervous whenever we start the class thinking that I won't survive :(",Disappointment,Sometimes instructions are unclear,Disappointment,"i had him as a prof for my 2nd year, i hope he's better now. kind of disappointed with the outcome cause, first OOP is like the still most mentioned thing til now that im in my 3rd year yet i still dont get it. i mean sir rham explained it somehow so if it werent for him i'll still be clueless about everything that happened. also sir whesley is so hard to find after class. and the fact that he gave the whole class i think? the same grade says a lot about him to be honest.",Disappointment
i hope it'll be replaced with someone who takes the subject seriously.,Disappointment,"Honestly, nothing. Since she was not able to teach us anything throughout the course.",Disappointment,Lessons felt repetitive without variation in activities,Disappointment,"This course was the beginning for our web development and we were tasked to do some difficult implementations, but obviously we are new to this and we had a hard time—not because we can't do it but we don't know how to. We were thought basic web dev but we were tasked to do much more like implementing interactive maps.",Disappointment
"maybe the changes to improve this course is the consideration, sometimes he was unfair to unexpected events that can affect the students grade, attendance and un-inform of quiz or sometimes late remind that there is a quiz coming up which results in failed scores of my fellow students.",Disappointment,Nothing,Disappointment,"him giving us his whole pandemic zoom video call for our ""lessons"" and try to elaborate further but we still don't get it, (he's not trying) there's this one time where one of my classmate asked a question, he buffered and ignored it instead then proceeded with playing the vid cause he can't answer it lol.",Disappointment,"sir made 2 mistakes already with checking both my quiz and exams, (he wronged my right answers, didn't recorrect it with him cause he's scary T^T) he was my prof for 2 subjects already. he gives really low grades haha T__T . (he's my only 2.# in every sem along with 2 other profs, one is his wife T___T) its hard to enjoy his sub for the fact that i think he enjoys making his student suffer with his subject. (its my observation okay?) he isnt that considerate also, pretty mid with teaching. very scary with both as a prof and with grade giving. (he failed half of our class because of the surprise finals, which we thought was just a simple quiz day, i did well and was thankful that i didn't fail, but still, its pretty odd). ",Disappointment
"No more long introductions for time efficiency, should have a clear instructions for each matter so that the students will learn and absorb the information fast without asking too many questions that burns the time.",Disappointment,"none, there was no teaching, not even a single knowledge given ",Disappointment,Sometimes the low voice when he was teaching at lr4 and the people sitting at the back cant hear him.,Disappointment,I fully understand that because of some personal reasons our professor was not able to attend his class because he needs to be personally the one to process and also with the meetings but I hope that would be improved. The subject is indeed fun but the lack of teaching is making the subject least interesting.,Disappointment
to be less strict and be more student friendly,Disappointment,Too many ppts/docx,Disappointment,letting us explore on our own without guidance or headsup to our different path,Disappointment,"The explanations are ok, but a variety in tone and activities can definitely help students feel more engaged.",Disappointment
Maybe the time management,Disappointment,"None, I think it's best if he focuses on teaching the hands on rather than lectures only.",Disappointment,"the quizzes/exams, sometimes the questions are really specific (too detailed). making it necessary to memorize every part of the PPTs. This takes away from understanding the main ideas of the PPTs.",Disappointment,"please, when you are not coming to class, give a reason why, just like us when we're absent.",Disappointment
On how she teaches,Disappointment,I appreciate that sir show up to class sometimes,Disappointment,"his exams are so out of the expected, its like even if u study well its still not certain whether you'll pass, he likes including graphs and tables or drawings on the exams (we suffered) and all i can say is that, he likes giving us quiz/exam with the parts he/we didnt focus on while we were in discussion days. also he's so fast paced. like super fast, i take down notes i cant even catch up with him T___T and he's still so scary, but i like how he disciplines the class. ",Disappointment,"She must attend our class, we didn't learn anything from her.",Disappointment
"to provide us with more knowledge before starting our project, rather than beginning with no understanding and working on it blindly.",Disappointment,"Nothing, since they didn't teach us anything.",Disappointment,"PPT oriented, too much PPT knowledge less on the actual knowledge on how we apply it in real life scenario",Disappointment,"this instructor not only threw several subjects but failed miserably in teaching anything in the class, relied on students to teach themselves, can't even provide good feedback after each student reports. The advance db foundations aren't met, we had to learn it in other subjects and other resources. ",Disappointment
Take time teaching before giving projects (website project),Disappointment,"I like how Ma'am enjoys how her teaching goes, but why me INC Ma'am huhu. I did my best huhu",Disappointment,He’s running out of time.,Disappointment,"1.While project-based learning is valuable, I feel that key concepts and foundational knowledge are not being adequately covered in class. More comprehensive lectures would help students better understand the material.
2. Some projects seem unrelated to the course syllabus, making it challenging to connect them to the course objectives. Aligning projects with learning outcomes would enhance our understanding of the subject matter.",Disappointment
The course itself is fun but the time of our instructor to teach us that is what needs to improve,Disappointment,not always meeting the class,Disappointment,Low tone of voice,Disappointment,"she was my prof for 3 subjects i think? or 4? im not sure. pandemic days were a hassle, but with face to face class i can see that she's kind of okay with teaching. seems a bit off still with the read all explain all lessons. and most of her classes makes half of our class sleepy T___T she talks so slow (total opposite with sir arip) and its not that encouraging to listen to the topics, but if we look at how she teaches us, she's doing well. she answers questions also and elaborates more when needed. ",Disappointment
lacking of actual lessons and no unnecessary projects that do not relate to the subject,Disappointment,"Throughout the semester, the professor communicated clearly and consistently with the class, ensuring that we always understood the expectations and course requirements. Instructions were provided in a timely and organized manner, which helped us stay on track with our tasks. The professor was consistently present and approachable, making it easy for students to seek clarification and guidance whenever needed. There was a strong sense of support and involvement, and it was clear that the professor genuinely cared about our learning and development. These qualities greatly enhanced our understanding of the subject and allowed us to engage with the material in a meaningful and practical way.

",Disappointment,the instructor does not manage class time effectively,Disappointment,"The chance for learning Advanced Database through this course was wasted. We had a great time learning database concepts [PROFESSOR], and expectations were high for this subject since cc104 was the pre-requisite, but unfortunately we learned nothing through this course as the instructor always doesn't attend classes, doesn't give timely updates, and doesn't teach what the subject should teach the students and just masks it behind unreasonable projects, full identification/enumeration quizzes, and exams from ppts discussed by other students without teaching anything.",Disappointment
Change the instructor.,Disappointment,not always meeting the class and give time,Disappointment,the PPT is not easy to understand,Disappointment,"For me,we need more time in learningbecause i feel like we are significanlty behind in our learning po.Most of the topics now or in the upcoming semester seems to lack the basic foundation that we should have learned and taught before.i hope you understand sir.",Disappointment
"probably, actually teaching. ",Disappointment,I do not like the teaching method,Disappointment,"He takes too time to decide what example to show us. Also he did not make too much time for us because his wife is pregnant which is acceptable but he made us try a lot of things in a span of hours without teaching those lessons and the time given to us was i think less than 10 hours(which is highly acceptable), But we had face to face class until 7pm so we only had less than 4hrs to do it.",Disappointment,"Whenever he cancels the class 20 minutes before the scheduled time and it is very inconvenient and disappointing to be honest as not all of us reside near the school, and in most cases, his subject is the only one we are scheduled to attend that day. Not to mention, we always ask him if he will meet the class a day before or even couple of hours before the sched and he will only respond roughly 20-30mins before his class. 

I am also disappointed by the fact that he has only met the class, two or three times throughout the entire semester. And because of this, I only learned 10% of what I should have learned based on the syllabus. ",Disappointment
"she was our core/starter subject in first year, introduction to computing was her subject and computer programming 1 too i think and like for me it wasnt really that good. she doesnt excel with teaching hands on codes that much, but shes definitely good with explaining topics like how she is with electives 1. maybe when she's kind of more engaging and like interactive with students, she'll be alright.",Disappointment,"He is still great with explaining the lessons, not being dependent on ppts, and will actually make you and help you understand the topic he’s explaining. sometimes he explains things so fast some student cant catch up, if he can tone down a little itll be great.

"I don’t know if this is really how this subject is supposed to be taught and learned, but I think there are a bunch of concepts being tackled without practical application. All I need to do is memorize a bunch of stuff without understanding the underlying concepts. You could say that someone can pass the exam while being oblivious to the topic at the same time. In my case, this is quite possibly the most effective way to make someone hate learning. If possible integrate practical activities. ",Disappointment,The only thing I liked was when the class ended early.,Disappointment,"not meeting the class, assigning reports to students to avoid teaching, assigning a heavy task almost on par with our SE ( which would be passable if she actually taught us something)",Disappointment,I really hope that the instructor would've been more proactive and passionate in teaching. The course as a whole confused me more than actually learning something. I am better off just searching the topics up online.,Disappointment
The topics should atleast be more a bit easy and less complicated,Disappointment,"I appreciate that they showed up sometimes, but the lessons weren’t meaningful.",Disappointment,A bit fast in explaing,Disappointment,The prof needs more effort when teaching,Disappointment

The lectures didn’t make sense to me.",Disappointment,"she doesnt care as much, like she's fine with people at the back talking or sleeping, and not participating at all. i cant blame them though since its really plain and quiet when she teaches us. mostly reading whats on the ppt and elaborating each sentences, next thing you know we got quiz/exam next meet. (she's the same with [PROFESSOR], where today read elaborate lesson, next meet quiz. or sometimes just give out the ppts and modules then quiz directly)",Disappointment,Likes alot of students,Disappointment
"I strongly recommend incorporating hands on teaching methods during lab hours, especially for a subject like this where practical application is key to understanding the fundamentals. Relying solely on modles or extenal resources like Youtube tutorials places an unnecessary burden on students to self-learn, which can lead to inconsistent progress.",Disappointment,I liked how quiet the class was since the teaching wasn’t effective.,Disappointment,"Throughout the course, I found the instructor's teaching methods to be very ineffective. The explanations and instructions were often unclear, and there were no lectures since the instructor only made the students report a random topic, which became our basis for exams and quizzes. The instructor also lacks engagement and interest during classes. Additionally, the instructor was unresponsive to questions and did not provide adequate support for clarification of students.",Disappointment,Inconsistent announcement,Disappointment
I suggest the teacher shows us how they will code the said problem as inspiration since I know they are better at it than we are or just guide us on how to solve the problems like giving tips and strategies on how to solve the problem for the code like for syntaxes and so on. Overall nearly all coding subjects just let's us do our own thing like studying and watching YT and in some cases to other students that just doesn't work :(,Disappointment,I can’t recall anything that helped me understand the subject.,Disappointment,Teaching the course like reading it as a story and when explaining it will go on different directions and not related to his/her course anymore,Disappointment,Should've taught more and deeply about the course and topics involved.

I would recommend change the instructor to improve this course,Disappointment,I liked that I had time to self-study because the teaching wasn’t helpful.,Disappointment,If the code isn't working he'll make it as an activity,Disappointment,"meet more, give more lectures and content we can work on",Disappointment

As difficult it is to learn this subject and getting a little bit of nothing sounds like a waste of time.",Disappointment
Instructor meet us(students),Disappointment,"I liked that the class ended on time, that’s all.",Disappointment,nothing,Disappointment,"The instructor is unprofessional most of the time. During our defenses, she would not even let our members speak/explain properly because she would always interrupt and insist on something or point out something without even hearing the full explanation first before asking questions. Her questions and suggestions often lack context due to her poor listening skills during group presentations. She often speaks loudly or even eats in front of the students, a behavior that is also observed in other groups. Also, during our title proposal, her criteria were unclear, as she would approve title proposals immediately, but then it turns out during the defense that the concept already exists, which leads to conflict between groups.",Disappointment
Just attend and teach well,Disappointment,"Honestly, nothing to like—it was more stressful than helpful.",Disappointment,Hmm... I have no idea as well.,Disappointment,"It would have been better if the instructor did not gatekeep information like documentation outline, announcements, project criteria, etc. It would help students work on the project much earlier in the course and produce more quality outputs.

Schedule,Disappointment,"I liked that there were exams, but they didn’t reflect actual learning.",Disappointment,Their way of explaining,Disappointment,"The teacher did not teach everything about the subject due to inconsistent class attendance. But when we meet, the professor displays mastery of the subject but sometimes relies too much on what is on the displayed on the presentation screen.

Don't really rely the topics in wadwhani,Disappointment,None.

Improve the time frame of this subject.,Disappointment,"Honestly, nothing impressed me with the teaching style.",Disappointment,"What I find most challenging is when lessons are skipped entirely or not explained in depth. [PROFESSOR] just simply post the learning materials without further elaboration whic leaves us students to figure things out independently or self-learning. Als when she practice of rushing through lessons and will just assume prior knowledge that some students may not have, which makes it difficult to keep up and succeed in the course.",Disappointment,More hands on,Disappointment
Improve timeframe for lab.,Disappointment,The best part was when I studied alone because I learned more that way.,Disappointment,"One  of my major concern is the lack of hands on teaching during lab hours. Tho it was mentioned that the LEC instructor is responsible for teaching, the absence of practical guidance or hands on learning during lab sessions I think leaves a gap in our learning process. Lab hours should be an opportunity to directly apply what has been taught in lectures, ensuring us to understand and can use the concepts in real world scenarios. Without this, it becomes difficult for us to grasp the subject effectively.",Disappointment,"More discussions, and hands on practices coding and guided learning.",Disappointment
Guide us personally,Disappointment,Nothing—the lessons didn’t stick in my mind.,Disappointment,"There's nothing particular as well for this but I guess it's How she teaches? She only reads and doesn't give us advice on how to do it, I'm actually proud to be under someone like her since she's smart but really it's just how she teaches she doesn't execute well on trying to explain and give tips about it to us ",Disappointment,"More hands on practices, real-life projects, guide students comprehensively in learning as some student are not used to self-study and would require the assistance of the professor.",Disappointment
Synchronization of project with SE,Disappointment,"I liked the idea of lectures, but they weren’t effective.",Disappointment,Fast explanation,Disappointment,Attend more classes.,Disappointment
Enhance the topic,Disappointment,None. The classes just felt like plain reading.,Disappointment,"Just “showing” rather than “teaching”.
